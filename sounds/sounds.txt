Spatial Dominion is the original thing I made, with Success Condition and Fail Condition based on it. I admit it isn't really fitting, it was just what I spent the most time on. I also have a short menu loop based on it.

Faster and Faster is a separate short demo loop I made and I'm thinking of basing the actual proper theme on that because it's more upbeat and already started. Not sure if staying chip or not. Will probably make an elevator piano version just because even if it does wind up staying as chiptune, no guarantee that'll be finished.

I'll aim to drop final versions, however they may end up, in here by 12PM. Best of luck on the boxes!
